# EarnWhileYouLearn

This site is aimed at getting young adults (16–24) into worked based learning to gain valuable skills for them and the employer, this is achieved beyond the traditional methods as learners get to gain hands on experience in their chosen section but still obtain a qualification at the end of the apprenticeship.

My aim for this website is to be inviting and simple to use but also deliver enough information to get the learner / employer to reach out and make contact with us so we can pair them with the perfect learner / employer to meet each other’s needs.
